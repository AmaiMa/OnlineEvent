                Where AM and CNC fit in the workflow?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Additive manufacturing provides an alternative method in manufacturing, supplying geometric
                complexities. With AM it is also possible to cut down the manufacturing proccess by being able to
                create
                one complete part that has previously consisted of several separate components.
                However, it will most likely never achieve the level of roughness and accuracy of CNC
                machining.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately additive manufacturing should be considered complimentary, since it has qualities that
                traditional CNC machining does not possess and vice versa. For that reason there is a need for both.
