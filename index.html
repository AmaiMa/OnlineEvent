                This event was presented by <b>Dr. Laurence Coles</b> from <b>Added Scientific Limited.</b>

                The event took place on the 16th of February and the topic of the discussion was the progression of
                additive manufacturing, and whether it should be considered a disruptive technology for CNC
                machining.
            </p>

                Over the last decade AM has become increasingly popular, with more searches for 3D printing and
                additive manufacturing compared to CNC machining.
