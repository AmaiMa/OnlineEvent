            This event was presented by <b>Dr. Laurence Coles</b> from <b>Added Scientific Limited.</b>

        <p>
            The event took place on the 16th of February and the topic of the discussion was the progression of
            additive manufacturing, and whether it should be considered a disruptive technology for CNC
            machining.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the last decade AM has become increasingly popular, with more searches for 3D printing and
            additive manufacturing compared to CNC machining.
